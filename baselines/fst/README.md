Pair n-gram baseline
====================

This directory contains a pair n-gram baseline, similar to that used by
Lee et al.Â (in press).

To run:

1.  Enable the Conda environment as described in
    [`README.md`](../../README.md)
2.  Run [`sweep`](sweep). This may take a while.

Results are stored in the [`checkpoints`](checkpoints) directory.
